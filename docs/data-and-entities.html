        <h2>2. What is these datas and entities</h2>
        <p>
            There are a lot of datas and a lot of entities that are involved in this chat. It's probably not as many as
            you are expecting when I say that. But it is still a lot.
        </p>
        <section id="Section-2-a">
            <h3>A. Parasite (User)</h3>
            <p>
                This is the user entity. It's called a parasite because that's what a user is doing. Leeching all of the
                server resources in order to participate in digital social interaction.
            </p>
            <p>
                A parasite has several attributes:
            </p>
            <dl>
                <dt>id</dt>
                <dd>
                    Traditional "username"/"user id". utf8 string, varchar(128) in db. must be unique
                </dd>
                <dt>password</dt>
                <dd>duh</dd>
                <dt>username</dt>
                <dd>
                    This is used as a "display name". This must be unique, except that it can match this parasite's id.
                </dd>
                <dt>email</dt>
                <dd>ya</dd>
                <dt>last_active</dt>
                <dd>
                    Timestamp of the last known activity for this parasite. This is used to filter parasites for display
                    on the client.
                </dd>
                <dt>typing</dt>
                <dd>
                    This is set to TRUE via a socket message. TRUE means a typing indicator should be displayed on the
                    client.
                </dd>
                <dt>status</dt>
                <dd>One of: [offline/active/idle]. Set via socket message.</dd>
            </dl>
            <p>
                A parasite also has some optional settings, which are included in the parasite entity:
            </p>
            <dl>
                <dt>faction</dt>
                <dd>
                    Very important, it is the icon to use for this parasite's status in the user list. It shows when
                    they are active. It is beautiful. Values correspond directly to <a
                        href="https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&p=2&q=star%20wars">font awesome 5 star wars
                    icons</a>. while any string is "valid", the ones that will actually work are: ['first-order',
                    'first-order-alt', 'empire', 'galactic-republic', 'galactic-senate', 'jedi-order', 'mandalorian',
                    'old-republic', 'rebel', 'sith', 'trade-federation']
                </dd>
                <dt>color</dt>
                <dd>
                    Hex value of the color to display this parasite has chosen for their chat messages. There is no
                    server side validation for the colors, but the web client displays a color picker with the following
                    options that are relatively legible on a white background: ['#555555', '#ff5555', '#ee7733',
                    '#0fba0f', '#10b1c9', '#5555ff', '#bc84e0', '#f27e95', '#775634', '#991111', '#aa3300', '#118822',
                    '#186f7d', '#18187d', '#663388', '#b51ba6']
                </dd>
                <dt>soundSet</dt>
                <dd>
                    Parasites can choose between AIM sounds and MSN sounds straight out of the year 2000. Therefore,
                    valid values are ['AIM', 'MSN']. If an different value is set, the client should default to AIM.
                    This is not negotiable. AIM is the default. Client code will not be merge into master if it is not
                    using AIM as the default.
                </dd>
                <dt>volume</dt>
                <dd>
                    Default client volume level. This is set whenever a clients volume changes. Clients can have local
                    overrides for this value, but a connection from a new client will use this value initially.
                </dd>
            </dl>

        <section id="Section-2-b">
            <h3>B. Message</h3>
            <p>
                A message is the thing that makes this a chat. This is different from a "Socket Message" (see <a
                    href="socket-messages.html">Section 3</a>), which is what goes between the client and the server.
            </p>
            <p>Messages are ONLY saved in memory. Server restarts clear ALL messages from ALL places.</p>
            <p>
                Messages are partially sanitized by the server before sending out to clients. A preprocessing function
                is run on every message to do the following:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Find urls in the message body and wrap in &lt;a&gt;</li>
                <li>Convert emoji shortcodes to unicode characters</li>
                <li>Convert ascii emoticons to unicode characters</li>
                <li>
                    Escape any xhtml in the message if any unacceptable usages are found [script, audio, video, iframe,
                    img]
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>There are three types of messages - 'chat message', 'private message', and 'image'.</p>

                <h4>i. Chat Message</h4>
                <p>
                    Chat messages are what live in Rooms (see <a href="#Section-2-c">section 2.c</a>). They have several
                    attributes:
                </p>
                <dl>

                        The display name of the parasite who sent them message. Not the id! The client doesn't have to
                        figure it out. This preserves display name changes in the history.
                    </dd>

                        ID of the room the message was sent to. if this is not set, it means the message is "global",
                        and goes to all rooms

                    <dt>color</dt>
                    <dd>
                        color to use when displaying this message, based on the parasite's settings at the time the

                    An Image message's attributes vary depending on the destination. Image messages going to a Room look

                A room is a bucket of messages to which 1+ parasite have access. A room is created by a parasite, the
                "owner", who can also delete the room. Other parasites can be invited to the room, and can "Leave" if
                they join it. But only the original owner can delete it. The only room that cannot be joined, left, or
                deleted is room id 0, "General". This room has no owner and everyone is stuck in it forever. This forces
                public interaction.

            <h3>E. Alerts</h3>
            <p>
                Alerts are messages that are meant to be treated as "global" on the client. They are not meant for any
                room or thread, and come only from the server or client itself. Three types of alerts are defined by the
                server: ['fade', 'dismiss', 'permanent']. Other types of alerts, or differing alert behaviors, are
                client specific and not related to capital-A Alerts.
            </p>
            <p>
                NOTE: Alerts are different from chat messages with no Room. Alerts should not be displayed in the
                message log, but in some other part of the client UI.
            </p>
            <section id="Section-2-e-i">
                <h4>i. 'fade' type</h4>
                <p>
                    Fade type alerts should display on the client when the parasite is actively using the client. The
                    alert should fade after a resonable amount of time (web default is 3500ms).
                </p>
            </section>
            <section id="Section-2-e-ii">
                <h4>ii. 'dismiss' type</h4>
                <p>
                    Dismiss type alerts should stay visible on the client until dismissed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is not the same as an actionable alert. The web clients use these to display invitations and in
                    the socket reconnect flow, but that is client specific implementation. Dismiss type alerts only have
                    a 'Dismiss' action, and are for messages deemed more important from the server.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section id="Section-2-e-iii">
                <h4>iii. 'permanent' type</h4>
                <p>
                    Permanent type alerts should remain visible on the client until the client has taken whatever action
                    is necessary to clear them. For example, a web client version being out of sync with the server
                    results in the server sending a Permanent type alert to that client, which suggests that the client
                    be reloaded. Permanent alerts should only be displayed when sent from the server or otherwise
                    necessary for proper client functioning (e.g. the client is disconnected from the server)
